# Chat Application 

This is a Chat Application made with React.js.

A clone of the Chat Application made by Web Dev Simplified (YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/tBr-PybP_9c). The intent of coding the project was mostly to put what I recently learned about React.js into a fun project.

# Getting started
Follow the instruction in order to set up this project on your local computer to run on localhost or on the local network.

Download the entire project and open the command prompt.
Open the folder client (cd client) and run npm install to install all dependencies. In order to start the react application run npm start.
Towards running the socket.io server, open a new command prompt and open the folder server. Now run npm install to install all dependencies and then npm run devStart to start the socket.io server, which should log the message: "Socket io Server runs on Port 3001".

Now you can access the project in a browser at localhost:3000 or http://<your_ip_address>:3000 in your local network.
